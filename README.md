## Code Class Diagram
This diagram shows how Maltigi’s Haunted Mansion is organized: the Game manages the Player, Enemy, Tasks, and Keys, while each class handles its own behavior like moving, chasing, or completing objectives. Together, they create a system where the player completes tasks to collect keys and escape while avoiding Maltigi.
